Builder4J  1.0
==============

This is a java development tool based on Apache Ant 1.6 which is currently supporting some cool features I've faced through my dev-life ! I'm really looking forward to hear tips from you. ;)

Installiation:
--------------
There's no easier way than expanding the "builder4j.zip" archive to any directory you feel easy browsing.

Usage:
------
Run build.bat (with no option) to see the usage help message.You should define your project home directory with command line options to build.bat.

Directory Structure:
--------------------
Builder4J assumes that you have such a directory structure under your project home directory ( e.g. P_H_D ):

 P_H_D ---
          + src ---
	  |    	   |
	  |    	   |---your java sources & packages
	  |        |
	  |        |
	  |        + resources ---
	  |		 	  |
	  |			  |---extra files which will be included in your packaged jar file
	  |
	  |
	  + lib ---
	  |	   |
	  |	   |---your project jar libraries.
